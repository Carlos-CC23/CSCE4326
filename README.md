# CSCE4326
Project for OS Spring 2025

-Building a Basic Operating System

-Team Members: Carlos Chacon & Dante Trevino

## Description
This project simulates an operating system's CPU scheduling (FCFS, SJF Non-Preemptive, SJF Preemptive) and virtual memory management using per-process page tables and virtual-to-physical address translation.

## Features
- User Authentication
- Process State Transitions
- Scheduling Algorithms:
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
- Virtual Memory:
  - Page table per process
  - Address translation with page mapping
  - Page fault simulation (basic)

## How to Compile

-When using g++ , follows these steps to compile & run program:
-
type -> g++ main.cpp auth.cpp Process.cpp scheduling.cpp -o os_simulator.exe
  
  then type -> .\os_simulator.exe
